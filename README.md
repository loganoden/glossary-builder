## 📄 Overview
Glossary Builder is a Java-based program that converts a list of terms and definitions into an alphabetically ordered HTML glossary.  
The system automatically generates an index page and multiple term-definition pages, creating N + 1 pages for N terms, and ensures full hyperlinking between terms and their definitions.

## ⚙️ Features
- Automated HTML generation that produces an alphabetized index page and individual term-definition pages  
- Modular design with six static methods for parsing, sorting, and hyperlinking logic  
- Comprehensive testing with 13 JUnit test cases, achieving 95% code coverage across routine, challenging, and edge scenarios
